- array.sort()
    - O(n^2) for 10 or fewer items, space O(1)
    - O(nlog(n)) for longer, space O(logn)
    


# Space complixity:
    - two seperate array that might have n elements.
    - Should be O(n), because like sequial for loops, they are executing symontanlously,(same time)
        so n + n = 2n => O(n)
